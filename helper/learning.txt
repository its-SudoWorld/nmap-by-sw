Introduction to Nmap:
Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free and open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It's designed to scan large networks rapidly, but it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.

Uses of Nmap:
- Network inventory
- Managing service upgrade schedules
- Monitoring host or service uptime
- Identifying open ports on a target host
- Detecting security vulnerabilities

Some Nmap Commands and Their Uses:

1. Basic Scan: `nmap {ip}` - Performs a simple scan on the specified IP.
2. Service Version Detection: `nmap -sV {ip}` - Detects the version of the services running on the target's open ports.
3. Scan All Ports: `nmap -sV -p- {ip}` - Scans all 65535 ports to find open ports and service versions.
4. Aggressive Scan: `nmap -A {ip}` - Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
5. OS Detection: `nmap -O {ip}` - Attempts to identify the operating system running on the target.
6. Full Port Scan: `nmap -p- {ip}` - Scans all ports without attempting to identify the services.
7. TCP Connect Scan: `nmap -sT {ip}` - Performs a full TCP connection scan.
8. UDP Scan: `nmap -sU {ip}` - Scans for open UDP ports.
9. Script Scan: `nmap -sC {ip}` - Runs a script scan using the default set of scripts.
10. SYN Scan: `nmap -sS {ip}` - Performs a stealthy SYN scan.
11. ACK Scan: `nmap -sA {ip}` - Scans using ACK packets.
12. FIN Scan: `nmap -sF {ip}` - Uses FIN packets to scan.
13. Window Scan: `nmap -sW {ip}` - Scans using window field of the TCP header.

Each of these commands serves a unique purpose, making Nmap a powerful tool in the hands of an ethical hacker. Whether you're conducting a simple network inventory or engaging in a full-blown security audit, Nmap provides the flexibility and depth needed to uncover the secrets hidden within networked systems.
